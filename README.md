# best-food-in-vancouver

This is my first ever full stack project!

It is part of the CPSC 2600 Full Stack Web Dev I course taught by Prof. Jordan Miller.

The application contains a front-end built by React, and a backend and database built by Node.js(incl. Express) and Mongoose.

## Design

### MongoDB Schema

- Food (is also a sub Schema of Cuisine)
- Restaurant
- Cuisine

### User Interface

- Food name
- Restaurant (as ref.)
- Cuisine type
- Travel time (from where?)
- Description
- Checkbox: Michelin Star
- (optional: location shown on map)
